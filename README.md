# Enigma Machine Frontend
This repository is the frontend for my Enigma Machine API. 

## Features
This codebase was built to provide a simple React framework based example that could talk to my c# based API. 
* Code was written using React Components
* Ajax work was written using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), which allowed my Get and Post communication to the API
* The application uses Less CSS for styling and Webpack for bundling
* The project began with [React Boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/), however; is a regret due to the complexity of the boilerplate and lack of complexity in the project
* The hosting environment is an AWS S3 bucket with web hosting enabled to achieve a serverless hosting environment

## Status
This is an active project that I will continue to grow and build additional features out. If you'd like to see one added, please add a feature request in the Issues tab.
